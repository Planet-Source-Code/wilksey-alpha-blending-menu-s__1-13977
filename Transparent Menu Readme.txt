Transparent Menu Readme
=========================
Hey Fellow VB Programmers, Wilksey Here, with a exceptionally cool release.

If you use Notepad, make sure you got Wordwrap on(Format, Wordrap)
else the text will be screwed.

Anyway, this example gives you a small taster of what the AlphaBlend function found in Windows 98, 98SE, WinME, Win2k can do!

This short menu system is so easy to use as well.

I have not commented on this, nor have i given instructions on how to add more menus, thats why i put it as an advanced piece of code, Pro's and many Intermediate programmers will be able to decode it into something they understand.

Ive included all code needed to write your own, or if you feel you must, steal mine, but give credit.
I have obtained a few lines of code from various sources, for once it not being PSC, mainly KPDTeams wonderfull program API-Guide, which can be found at www.allapi.net

I hope you have fun with this, it was coded in VB6, But there are no VB6 specific functions in here, so it should work with VB5.

Pictures was made in Paint Shop Pro 6, the Soap Bubbles bitmap is part of Windows 2000.

Tested in Win 98 and 2K.

Have a nice day, and HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL. 31/12/00

This is my last submission for the Yr 2000 *sob*
